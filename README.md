# IgnoBot.py

This is the successor of IgnoBot.js, which was not working at all, other than being very slow.

IgnoBot is now a :duck:, finally works (and is much faster) and is written using the Python programming language :D

### Note

> This bot was tested and developed using Python 3.10. I know it works with python 3.9, as this is the version that is often used by hosting providers. I don't know if it works with any past version, but will not be testing versions myself, as that would take *too long*, ~~sorry~~.
> You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://python.org/downloads)
